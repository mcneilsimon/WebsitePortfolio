/* Javascript is one the three core languages for websites. It's main responsibility is to add behvior and 
   interactivity to your website. Cannot communicate directly with a database. It is a client side language meaning that it runs 
   directly in your computer browser.
    
   There are 3 ways to add js code to your webpage. 
        - Adding js code inside the head section inside the html document
        - Adding js code inside the body section of your html document
        - Writing js code in an external file and import it to yoru html document.

/* HOW TO USE JQUERY

    - basic structure for jQuery, grab a selector then performing some action on it
        - $(selector).action()
        
  document.ready, this makes the function available after the 
  document structure is ready. It is always a good practice to have 
  all the jQuery events and functions inside this document.ready method
  
  The proper way to now writing the $(document).ready(function() {})
  is now simply by writing $(function() {})
  
$(function() {
    $('h1').hide(500).show(500) //will hide the h1 element, 500 will make the h1 tag fade out 

    //an alternate method to the above jQuery action is 
    $('h1').slideUp(1000).slideDown(1000);

    //select element using id
    $("#main").css({
        color: 'red',
        fontSize: 25
    });

    //select an element using class
    $(".content").css({
        color: 'blue',
        fontSize: 50
    });


    //implementing an action
    $("h1").click(function() {
        $(".content").css({
            color: 'green',
            fontSize: 50
        });
    });
});



  $(window).on("load", functoon() {}); Window on load event fires
    when all the content on the page is fully loaded including the DOM, 
    images, and content.
    
    $(function() {}) loads a bit earlier then $(window).on("load", functoon() {}). This loads only when the DOM is ready. 

$(window).on("load", function() {
   alert("window is loaded") 
});
